### Strapi 5 Upgrades
There was a lot of work to migrate this plugin to Strapi 5 because of the size of it. The deprecated APIs were replaced, and all the deprecated components updated to the new Strapi design system.

- **Import** - seems to work okay (there is a known issue from the original plugin where the deepness dropdown doesn't work when the number of levels is high)
- **Export** - seems working, need testing
- Admin dashboard components (converted a lot of deprecated imports)
    - replaced select dropdowns
    - updated checkboxes to use radix api
    - loads of other similar stuff
- **Server** â€“ converted to ESM so it can be used in Strapi 5
- **Removed most typescript** because it was causing issues, some types became out of date or could not be found.  
- **Replaced `strapi.entityService`** - this is deprecated, replaced with `strapi.documents`
